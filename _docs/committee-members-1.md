<h2>Appointment</h2>

<ol>
<li>Committee members are formally appointed to the committee by resolution of the Majlis.&nbsp; Standing committee members are appointed for the duration of the Parliament unless they change parties. Select committees are appointed for the duration of the committee.</li>
<li>The number of members, and party balance, on each committee is decided by the Majlis at the beginning of each Parliament, taking into account the party proportions in the Majlis and the level of interest in each committee.</li>
<li>Committee members are nominated by the leader of their political group (or, for independent members, by the Speaker). &nbsp;</li>
<li>It is possible for committee members to resign from the committee, by writing to the Speaker.</li>
</ol>
<h2>First meeting</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are appointed to a committee, you may expect to be contacted by the committee clerk and sent a notification of the first meeting. It is standard procedure to notify members of meetings.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Before the first meeting, it can be good practice that you supply the clerk with a list of your financial interests and any non-financial interests which are relevant to service on the committee (for example, membership of boards and other organisations or professional affiliations).&nbsp; These may then be circulated to the committee before the election of the chairperson [and will be published in the minutes of the meeting].&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Election of committee chairpersons and deputy chairpersons</h2>
<p>The first task for a committee is to elect a chairperson. The chairperson may be from any party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some overseas Parliaments (including many commonwealth parliaments such as UK House of Commons), a number of committees are allocated Opposition chairpersons, in line with the party proportions in the Parliament. It is also an established convention in many Parliaments that some committees &ndash; notably the Public Accounts Committee [but sometimes also the Committee on Members&rsquo; Ethics] &ndash; have an Opposition chairperson.</p>

<li>Committees are also required to elect a deputy chairperson to act as chair if the chairperson is absent. &nbsp; The deputy chairperson may be from any party.</li>
