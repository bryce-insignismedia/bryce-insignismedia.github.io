<h3><span>Investigations</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Standing Orders state that committees may hold meetings to investigate a particular matter, such as where a government institution or a civil servant is suspected of acting in contravention of the law;&nbsp; and, in such cases, the committee may formulate laws to address the issues.</span><span>&nbsp; In practice, committees may choose to conduct investigations into a wide range of matters, including policy issues.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>In carrying out their investigatory function, Committees generally proceed by a process of inquiry:&nbsp; seeking information / taking evidence, formulating conclusions, and publishing a report. Inquiries may take very different forms to fit the circumstances and the time available, ranging from a single evidence session (possibly even without a report) to a complex and lengthy inquiry, comprising multiple formal evidence sessions and informal information-gathering, and the agreement of a major report.&nbsp; The sections below describe the elements that committees might particularly wish to consider when planning a longer inquiry, though some of them are also applicable to shorter work or single evidence sessions.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Launching inquiries&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Before launching an inquiry, it is important that the committee agrees on its scope:&nbsp; broadly what issues it is going to cover and how long it is going to be.&nbsp; If the committee has been instructed to carry out a particular inquiry by the Majlis, then the scope may already have been defined and a deadline for completion fixed. If not, the committee will need to discuss this. It is not essential to agree detailed terms of reference (there may be benefit in retaining some flexibility), but you will at least need to give witnesses a clear idea of what issues they should address.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>If time permits, you could consider consulting stakeholders or subject experts on what the important issues are before launching the inquiry.&nbsp; You could consider holding an informal seminar or hosting a webforum on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>You may wish to launch the inquiry by publishing a news release with a call for written evidence, giving guidance on how to submit evidence and the deadline.&nbsp; Information about the inquiry should be made easily accessible on the Majlis website. It is also open to committees to hold a press conference or a stakeholder event to publicise the launch of major inquiries</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>You should identify the key organisations and experts involved in your inquiry&rsquo;s subject area and invite them to give written evidence.&nbsp; If the inquiry would benefit from the personal testimony of the public, you will need to think how best to reach the groups affected. You could ask stakeholder organisations or online networks to advertise your inquiry.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Particularly if your inquiry addresses issues of disability, you should consider how your call for evidence can be made most accessible to those affected:&nbsp; for example, you could publish an easy-read version or a video with Sign language.&nbsp; If you wish the inquiry to be informed by evidence from people in marginalised groups or remote communities, you may need to provide additional time, or use innovative approaches, to reach them.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Communication plans</span></h3>
<ol start="6">
<li aria-level="2"><span>It is worthwhile drawing up a communication plan before the launch of an inquiry, identifying the target audiences and how they will be reached.&nbsp; It should cover all stages of the inquiry (not just launch and report publication).&nbsp; For example, fact-finding visits can be a good opportunity to engage local media and to publicise your inquiry to the local community.&nbsp; Individual members can help to communicate the committee&rsquo;s work in their different areas. This plan can be developed as the inquiry goes on and may help to maintain focus on intended outcomes.</span></li>
