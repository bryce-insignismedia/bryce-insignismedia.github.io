<h3><span>Programme planning for the Parliament </span></h3>

<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Standing Orders require committees to draw up a workplan, showing how they will carry out oversight of their area of Government.</span><span>&nbsp; It can be useful for committees to discuss what they wish to achieve during the Parliament, and how they wish to prioritise their time. And having a plan in place helps to ensure that the committee covers the range of its responsibilities. However, it is important that the plan is sufficiently flexibly to allow the committee to respond to events, and to review its priorities from time to time.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Standing Orders state that, when putting together their workplan, committees should consider:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Where there is another committee which has a mandate related to the work being carried out by the committee, then those two committees or various committees with overlapping mandates shall work in liaison.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Liaising with committees which has been assigned with related responsibilities whilst reviewing and analysing various laws, programmes and results achieved by various institutions.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Reviewing various regulations, policies and notifications of the Government and Court Orders in order to ascertain whether they give rise to more than one interpretation or whether the scope of the regulations are without limitations or imposes a financial burden on the public.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The business of the committee shall be organized in such a manner to allow for the complete review of all laws, programmes, administrative work and the results achieved within the area of responsibility of the committee in at least five year circles.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Ensuring that the objectives and the work of various programmes of the Government have been organized and planned in a manner, which does not cause conflicts between the same.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><span>Before putting together a workplan, it is advisable to establish what the Government is planning in their area of responsibility, perhaps by asking for a written paper or by inviting the Minister or senior officials to a meeting.&nbsp; The committee may want to ask, for example:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Are there likely to be bills or secondary legislation which the committee will need to scrutinise, and when?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there likely to be appointments which it will need to scrutinise, and when?</span></li>
<li><span>Is the institution responsible for delivering any major programmes, and, if so, are there particular milestones which the committee should take into account?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Is the Government planning to make any major policy decisions, or publish any policy proposals, and when?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Are there issues which the Government would like the committee to look into, or where it would find the committee&rsquo;s advice helpful?&nbsp; (The committee may not necessarily want to do exactly as the Government wishes, but it is useful as an indicator of where the Government might be receptive to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.)</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="2"><span>If there is a lot of government activity in the committee&rsquo;s area, much of its schedule may have to be devoted to that activity, leaving little time for the committee to carry out inquiries of its own choice.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>When planning the committee&rsquo;s work, it is important to be realistic about the time that committee members will be able to devote to committee business, given other demands, and the amount of staff resource available.&nbsp; It is important to allow sufficient time in each inquiry for information-gathering, particularly if the committee wishes to engage with the wider public, and for preparation of the committee&rsquo;s report. It is also worth building in some space and flexibility in the committee&rsquo;s schedule to allow it to respond to unexpected developments.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Depending on the resource available, the committee may be able to carry out more than one inquiry at a time, perhaps mixing a major investigative inquiry with some shorter inquiries or single evidence sessions.&nbsp; It may be able to sequence its work efficiently by scheduling single appointment hearings or legislative scrutiny meetings while waiting for evidence to come in for a major inquiry.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees may wish to consult relevant stakeholder organisations, or the wider public, on their draft workplan.&nbsp; As well as demonstrating transparency and perhaps generating good ideas, this may help to promote a positive relationship with stakeholders that will be useful in the committee&rsquo;s future work.</span></li>
