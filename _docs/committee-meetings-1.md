<h1><span>Committee meetings&nbsp;</span></h1>
<h3><span>Time of meetings&nbsp;</span></h3>

<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees are free to decide when they wish to meet.&nbsp; It is usually convenient for committees to meet on a day when the Majlis is in session, but they may meet at other times if they wish.</span><span> The Standing Orders require committees to meet at least once every 14 days.</span><span>&nbsp; The usual length of meetings is 1 hour 30 minutes.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Under SO140, three members of the committee may write jointly to the Secretary General requesting a special meeting of the committee</span><em><span>. </span></em></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Location</span></h3>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees normally meet in a committee room at the Majlis. However, they may, if they wish, meet elsewhere in Maldives or abroad. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Remote / virtual participation&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Since the Covid-19 pandemic, Committees have been permitted to meet virtually. Both Members of the Committee and witnesses may participate in Committee meetings virtually, from a remote location. The clerk can give advice on the operating procedures.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Purpose of meeting&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="5">
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Standing Orders identify five purposes for which committee meetings may be held</span><span>:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Law-making</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Government accountability</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Investigation</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Review of appointments</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Unofficial planning meetings.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>The time that is spent on each of these activities will vary, depending on the Committee&rsquo;s responsibilities.&nbsp; For example, some committees [eg the Government Institutions Committee] will not be required to scrutinise any bills but will focus on accountability.&nbsp;</span></p>
