<li aria-level="2"><span>Each committee is supported by a committee clerk and two support staff, who are members of the parliamentary service of the Majlis.&nbsp; The clerk will work to support the chairperson in managing the committee&rsquo;s programme and delivering its workplan, but is also available &ndash; as far as their time permits - to assist and advise other members of the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The staff team will:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>keep up to date with emerging issues in the committee&rsquo;s subject area</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>suggest potential inquiries and their scope and focus</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>research and propose potential witnesses (to give both written and oral evidence) once an inquiry subject has been chosen</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>organise oral evidence sessions once the committee has chosen witnesses</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>provide briefing and suggested questions for those sessions</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>manage the process of inquiries</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>engage with the expert community and other stakeholders in the area of the committee&rsquo;s remit on its behalf</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>engage with the government in the necessary official-level negotiations</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>engage with the public and help the committee to do so</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>analyse the evidence received</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>brief the committee on key issues and emerging findings</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>draft reports at the end of each inquiry on the chairperson&rsquo;s behalf and under their authority</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>draft amendments to those reports for other members of the committee, on request&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>support the chairperson in his or her role as the public face of the committee</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>draft press notices for the chairperson and committee, and issue them when reports are published</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>maintain the committee&rsquo;s web pages and manage its social media presence, and</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>arrange committee visits, receiving of inward delegations and other events.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<li><span>Please bear in mind that your clerk may be supporting a number of committees and may have limited time to support individual committee members. Also, as a member of the impartial parliamentary service, the clerk / staff cannot assist committee members with work that is party political in nature or purpose.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>It is open to committees to request additional staff on a temporary basis if need arises</span><em><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></em></li>
<li>
<p><span>Committee staff have a right to be treated with respect and to work in a supportive environment in which bullying or harassment are not tolerated. It is a matter for each parliament to decide how any complaints of ill-treatment will be investigated and dealt with.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In return, committee members can expect to receive a courteous and efficient service from their staff team. If you are not satisfied, please raise your concern with the clerk or, if this does not resolve the matter, with the Counsel-General.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Chairpersons should seek to develop a positive working relationship with the committee clerk, setting the overall direction of the committee&rsquo;s programme while allowing the clerk some freedom to administer the programme on a day-to-day basis. It is usually helpful to have an early and clear discussion of mutual expectations and boundaries &ndash; including practical matters, such as how best to contact each other and whether it is reasonable to expect response outside working hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
