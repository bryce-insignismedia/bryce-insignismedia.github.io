<meta name="description" content="Committee functions and powers Committee functions Committees are of two types:&nbsp; standing committees (which are established on a permanent basis) and select committees (which are established on a temporary basis to carry out a particular task). Most standing committees are responsible for oversight of government institutions, but some are responsible for aspects of parliamentary work, such as the procedure of the Majlis and petitions.&nbsp; (See Appendix &hellip; for a list of Majlis Committees.) The purpose of each committee is set out in the Standing Orders.&nbsp; Each committee is free to interpret its own mandate, within the terms of its founding Standing Order, and to determine its own business, subject to any direction from the Majlis or from the Speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majlis or the Speaker may refer matters to committees and, in case of dispute between committees, may decide which committee should consider a matter. Committee powers Powers to summon witnesses and documents Each committee has the power to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of correspondence, books, recordings, papers, letters, documents.&nbsp; While this power may be enforced if required, it is usual for committees to operate by persuasion wherever possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Power to appoint sub-committees Each committee has power to set up sub-committees to carry out a specified responsibility. A sub-committee has the same powers and ways of working as the&nbsp;main committee, but all its decisions are subject to the agreement of the main committee. Sub-committees should appoint their own chairperson. Joint committee working Standing committees may decide to work together as a joint committee if their responsibilities overlap. For example, the Joint Committee on Economic Affairs &amp; Environment and Climate Change. Alternatively, it is open to committees to work together informally. Privilege and freedom of information (if applicable)&nbsp; Committee proceedings are protected by parliamentary privilege.&nbsp; This means that anything said in formal meetings, by Members or by witnesses, cannot be challenged in the courts.&nbsp; Members should exercise the privilege of freedom of speech responsibly and should also respect the sub judice rule, avoid referring to cases which are active in the courts. Privilege does not apply to informal activities &ndash; for example, to things said in press conferences or in a television interview &ndash; so Members should be careful in what they say. Parliamentary privilege applies to witnesses giving oral evidence in formal committee meetings and to written evidence accepted by the committee.&nbsp; In principle, witnesses cannot be penalised for what they say in either written or oral evidence, and any attempt to do so might constitute a contempt of Parliament.&nbsp; However, in practice, it might be difficult for Parliament to defend a witness who, for example, lost their job after giving evidence about their employer, so caution should be exercised in advising potential whistleblowers." />

<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees are of two types:&nbsp; standing committees (which are established on a permanent basis) and select committees (which are established on a temporary basis to carry out a particular task).</span><span> Most standing committees are responsible for oversight of government institutions, but some are responsible for aspects of parliamentary work, such as the procedure of the Majlis and petitions.</span><span>&nbsp; (See Appendix &hellip; for a list of Majlis Committees.)</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The purpose of each committee is set out in the Standing Orders.&nbsp; Each committee is free to interpret its own mandate, within the terms of its founding Standing Order, and to determine its own business, subject to any direction from the Majlis or from the Speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Majlis or the Speaker may refer matters to committees and, in case of dispute between committees, may decide which committee should consider a matter.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Committee powers</span></h3>
<p><span>Powers to summon witnesses and documents</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Each committee has the power to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of correspondence, books, recordings, papers, letters, documents.</span><span>&nbsp; While this power may be enforced if required, it is usual for committees to operate by persuasion wherever possible.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<span>Power to appoint sub-committees</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span>Each committee has power to set up sub-committees to carry out a specified responsibility.</span> <span>A sub-committee has the same powers and ways of working as the&nbsp;main committee, but all its decisions are subject to the agreement of the main committee. Sub-committees should appoint their own chairperson.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Joint committee working</span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Standing committees may decide to work together as a joint committee if their responsibilities overlap.</span><span> For example, the Joint Committee on Economic Affairs &amp; Environment and Climate Change. Alternatively, it is open to committees to work together informally.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Privilege and freedom of information (</span><em><span>if applicable</span></em><span>)&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="7">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee proceedings are protected by parliamentary privilege.</span><span>&nbsp; This means that anything said in formal meetings, by Members or by witnesses, cannot be challenged in the courts.&nbsp; Members should exercise the privilege of freedom of speech responsibly and should also respect the sub judice rule, avoid referring to cases which are active in the courts. Privilege does not apply to informal activities &ndash; for example, to things said in press conferences or in a television interview &ndash; so Members should be careful in what they say.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Parliamentary privilege applies to witnesses giving oral evidence in formal committee meetings and to written evidence accepted by the committee.</span><span>&nbsp; In principle, witnesses cannot be penalised for what they say in either written or oral evidence, and any attempt to do so might constitute a contempt of Parliament.&nbsp; However, in practice, it might be difficult for Parliament to defend a witness who, for example, lost their job after giving evidence about their employer, so caution should be exercised in advising potential whistleblowers.</span></li>
