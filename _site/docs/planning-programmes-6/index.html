                        <p>«h3&gt;<span>Agreeing reports</span>&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee reports are usually drafted by the clerk, or another member of the staff team, on behalf of the chairperson.&nbsp; The chairperson will usually aim for the report to reflect the consensus on the committee, or (if there are differing views which cannot be reconciled) the majority view.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Before the report is drafted, it may be helpful for the committee to meet to discuss its conclusions and potential recommendations.&nbsp; The clerk may draft a &ldquo;heads of report&rdquo; document to aid this discussion, outlining the issues to be covered, and perhaps setting out draft recommendations or identifying alternative options.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>In general, reports have most impact if they are not too long and include a short summary at the beginning.&nbsp; They are most credible if they are evidence-based and if recommendations are clearly targeted and realistic. And they carry more weight if they are agreed unanimously.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees may give the chairperson authority to finalise and publish the report without discussion by the committee.&nbsp; However, if the matter is at all controversial, it is important that the committee as a whole should consider and agree the report.&nbsp; It is open to committee members to propose amendments :&nbsp; the clerk may be able to help with this.&nbsp; It is usual for committees to discuss the draft report, and make amendments to it, informally, before formally agreeing to the report.&nbsp; However, it is open to members to ask to move amendments formally, and they will then be recorded in the minutes even if not agreed by the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Publication of reports&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="5">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Once a report is agreed, the secretariat will prepare it for publication and will&nbsp; place it on the agenda (at least three days in advance) for the chairperson to present the report to the Majlis.&nbsp; On the appointed day, the chairperson will be called by the Speaker to present the report, and other members may also contribute, for up to one hour.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The committee should review its communication plan and consider how best to get the report maximum impact.&nbsp; What is important is to make sure that it is read by the target audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>It is usual for committees to publish a press release highlighting the key conclusions and recommendations of the report and including comments from the chairperson.&nbsp; It may be possible to arrange media interviews for the chairperson to talk about the report, or to place articles in the press.&nbsp; Media coverage is helpful in publicising the report but it is important to be realistic about the likely level of interest.&nbsp; Not every report will be national news, and it may be more effective to focus on the specialist or local media.&nbsp; It may also be possible to work in partnership with civil society organisations to disseminate the report to their network of contacts, and to add pressure on the Government to respond positively.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Follow-up</span></h3>
<ol start="8">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Publication of the report should not be seen as the end of the process.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>While the Government is not required to respond to committee reports, it is open to committees to follow-up with Ministers to implement their recommendations or to respond to the matters set out in the report.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>In the longer-term, particularly if the Government has accepted its recommendations, the committee may want to monitor developments to make sure they are implemented and to assess the effect.&nbsp; The committee might consider asking the relevant government institution for a progress report, perhaps a year or two later, or the committee could carry out a short follow-up inquiry.&nbsp; Of course, this takes time and resource, so the committee might select the reports which it regards as most important for detailed follow-up.</span></li>
