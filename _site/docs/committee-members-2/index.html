<meta name="description" content="Responsibilities of the chairperson The principal responsibilities of the chairperson, as set out in the Standing Orders, are: Conducting committee meetings Taking initiative and maintaining the focus of the work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensuring timely completion of work without unreasonable delays. Obtaining the requisite information through the secretariat of the committee. Coordinating the work of the secretariat. Obtaining statistical data and other documents required for the work of the committee through the secretariat of the committee. Presiding over the meeting. Representing the committee where applicable. Communicating with the media on behalf of the committee. It is usual practice for committees to delegate to the chair the authority to make routine administrative decisions, for example about the committee&rsquo;s programme.&nbsp; In exercising this authority, the chairperson should, where possible, operate in line with the committee consensus and should consult the committee on any matters which are contentious. If the chairperson loses the confidence of the committee, they can be removed.&nbsp; (The procedure for a no confidence vote is set out in SO 134.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsibilities of committee members Attendance at meetings Committee members are expected to attend committee meetings. If they are unable to do so, they should inform the chairperson [or the clerk?] in advance. The committee cannot function unless the agreed quorum is present. Members who repeatedly fail to attend meetings may be referred to the Ethics and Privileges Committee and may be removed from the committee. It is good practice for committee members to arrive in time for the beginning of committee meetings and to remain till the end.&nbsp; This is courteous to other Members and to witnesses, demonstrates commitment to the public, and helps the Committee to operate effectively. Conduct at meetings Members should behave with decorum in committee meetings, bearing in mind that they are formal proceedings of the Majlis, but it is acceptable to speak more informally than is customary in the plenary.&nbsp; Members should treat each other with respect but it is not essential to refer to others as &ldquo;the Honourable Member&rdquo; or to direct everything you say to the chairperson. Members should wear appropriately formal dress when attending committee meetings, in the same way as when attending the plenary. [This means a shirt and tie for men, and modest dress for women.] This helps to convey to witnesses and the public that the meeting is a formal parliamentary proceeding.&nbsp; Respect for witnesses It is important for the reputation of the Majlis that Members treat with witnesses with respect.&nbsp; Treating witnesses politely is also usually more productive in encouraging them to give full and useful evidence.&nbsp; If the evidence is unsatisfactory, you can make your criticism clear in the committee&rsquo;s report:&nbsp; you should not prejudge the committee&rsquo;s conclusions when taking evidence. Gender sensitivity [or Sensitivity to gender and minority rights] Members should be mindful of the rights of women [and of minorities] in all aspects of the committee&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; This means, for example, ensuring that the committee&rsquo;s programme takes due account of gender issues and that the gender impacts of policy proposals are fully assessed, and that women are given equal access to giving evidence.&nbsp; Transparency and confidentiality&nbsp;&nbsp; In normal circumstances, committees are required to meet in public and to be open to the media. This is in the interests of transparency and good governance.&nbsp; However, it is open to committees to exclude the public and the press from all or any part of the proceedings if there is a compelling need to do so in the interests of public order or national security. &nbsp; Committee members should keep evidence taken in closed session in confidence and should not divulge the contents of Committee reports unless agreed by majority of the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conflicts of interest Committee members should guard against any conflict of interest that might impact, or be perceived to impact, on your committee work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be good practice to declare all relevant interests, both financial and non-financial, at the first meeting of the committee, and again at any subsequent meeting to which they are relevant, so that witnesses and the public are aware of them.&nbsp; This is important for transparency and to protect members from allegations of impropriety. If you have a direct financial or personal interest in the matter under inquiry, it is good practice not to take part in questioning witnesses or in the discussion of the committee&rsquo;s report. For example, if the committee is considering the appointment of a candidate who is a family member or close acquaintance, it is good practice not to take part, as it would bring the committee&rsquo;s impartiality into question. &nbsp;" />

                        <h2><span>Responsibilities of the chairperson</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span>The principal responsibilities of the chairperson, as set out in the Standing Orders, are:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Conducting committee meetings</span></li>
<li><span>Taking initiative and maintaining the focus of the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Ensuring timely completion of work without unreasonable delays.</span></li>
<li><span>Obtaining the requisite information through the secretariat of the committee.</span></li>
<li><span>Coordinating the work of the secretariat.</span></li>
<li><span>Obtaining statistical data and other documents required for the work of the committee through the secretariat of the committee.</span></li>
<li><span>Presiding over the meeting.</span></li>
<li><span>Representing the committee where applicable.</span></li>
<li><span>Communicating with the media on behalf of the committee.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><span>It is usual practice for committees to delegate to the chair the authority to make routine administrative decisions, for example about the committee&rsquo;s programme.&nbsp; In exercising this authority, the chairperson should, where possible, operate in line with the committee consensus and should consult the committee on any matters which are contentious.</span></li>
<li><span>If the chairperson loses the confidence of the committee, they can be removed.&nbsp; (The procedure for a no confidence vote is set out in SO 134.</span><span>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span>Responsibilities of committee members</span></h2>
<h3><span>Attendance at meetings</span></h3>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee members are expected to attend committee meetings. If they are unable to do so, they should inform the chairperson [</span><em><span>or the clerk?</span></em><span>] in advance. The committee cannot function unless the agreed quorum is present. Members who repeatedly fail to attend meetings may be referred to the Ethics and Privileges Committee and may be removed from the committee.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>It is good practice for committee members to arrive in time for the beginning of committee meetings and to remain till the end.&nbsp; This is courteous to other Members and to witnesses, demonstrates commitment to the public, and helps the Committee to operate effectively.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Conduct at meetings</span></h3>
<ol start="7l">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Members should behave with decorum in committee meetings, bearing in mind that they are formal proceedings of the Majlis, but it is acceptable to speak more informally than is customary in the plenary.&nbsp; Members should treat each other with respect but it is not essential to refer to others as &ldquo;the Honourable Member&rdquo; or to direct everything you say to the chairperson.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Members should wear appropriately formal dress when attending committee meetings, in the same way as when attending the plenary. [This means a shirt and tie for men, and modest dress for women.] This helps to convey to witnesses and the public that the meeting is a formal parliamentary proceeding.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Respect for witnesses</span></h3>
<ol start="9">
<li aria-level="2"><span>It is important for the reputation of the Majlis that Members treat with witnesses with respect.&nbsp; Treating witnesses politely is also usually more productive in encouraging them to give full and useful evidence.&nbsp; If the evidence is unsatisfactory, you can make your criticism clear in the committee&rsquo;s report:&nbsp; you should not prejudge the committee&rsquo;s conclusions when taking evidence.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Gender sensitivity [or Sensitivity to gender and minority rights]</span></h3>
<ol start="10">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Members should be mindful of the rights of women [and of minorities] in all aspects of the committee&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; This means, for example, ensuring that the committee&rsquo;s programme takes due account of gender issues and that the gender impacts of policy proposals are fully assessed, and that women are given equal access to giving evidence.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Transparency and confidentiality&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</h3>
<ol start="11">
<li aria-level="2"><span>In normal circumstances, committees are required to meet in public and to be open to the media. This is in the interests of transparency and good governance.&nbsp; However, it is open to committees to exclude the public and the press from all or any part of the proceedings if there is a compelling need to do so in the interests of public order or national security. </span><span>&nbsp; Committee members should keep evidence taken in closed session in confidence and should not divulge the contents of Committee reports unless agreed by majority of the committee.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Conflicts of interest</span></h3>
<ol start="12">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee members should guard against any conflict of interest that might impact, or be perceived to impact, on your committee work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>It can be good practice to declare all relevant interests, both financial and non-financial, at the first meeting of the committee, and again at any subsequent meeting to which they are relevant, so that witnesses and the public are aware of them.&nbsp; This is important for transparency and to protect members from allegations of impropriety.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>I</span><span>f you have a direct financial or personal interest in the matter under inquiry, it is good practice not to take part in questioning witnesses or in the discussion of the committee&rsquo;s report. For example, if the committee is considering the appointment of a candidate who is a family member or close acquaintance, it is good practice not to take part, as it would bring the committee&rsquo;s impartiality into question.</span></li>
</ol>
