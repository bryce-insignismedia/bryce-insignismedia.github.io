The aim of these meetings is to gather information on the requirements of the office and whether the nominee has had adequate preparation for the role, and to ascertain whether they are competent. It is important that the committee demonstrates objectivity and impartiality in considering public appointments. The candidate should be given a fair hearing, and the questioning should focus on the required competences for the role. If Members are a relation, or close acquaintance, of the candidate, it is good practice not to take part.&nbsp; If the committee rejects the candidate, the reasons should be made clear and should relate to the required competences for the role.&nbsp;" />

<li aria-level="2"><span>It is also up to the committee to decide who to invite to give evidence on the bill, in writing or orally.&nbsp; How many evidence sessions is appropriate will depend on the importance of the bill, how much time is available before the deadline for reporting, and what other demands there are on the committee&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; It is usual to invite the relevant government department or other state institution and key stakeholder bodies to provide written and oral evidence, but the committee may also want to hear the views of individual experts and people who are affected by the bill.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>After the committee has taken evidence on the bill, it considers the bill and Members may propose amendments to it.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>It is good practice to discuss and give notice of any amendments to clerk in advance, so that advice can be taken on the drafting. Amendments moved without notice risk being technically defective or inconsistent and may make the proposed law ineffective.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Government accountability</span></h3>
<ol start="6">
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Standing Orders provide that committees may decide to hold meetings to assess the manner in which the Government is discharging their responsibilities; or to assess, in the light of the relevant policy or the relevant provisions of law, the manner in which projects and programmes are being implemented or how a specific matter is being administered by the Government. The purpose might be to ensure that the work of the relevant Government institutions are being carried out in accordance with the intentions with which Majlis had passed the law or in a manner which most effectively protects the interests of the public, or to ensure value for money and efficient delivery of the intended outcome.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>In order to carry out this function, committees might consider a number of approaches:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Holding an annual meeting with the Minister and/or senior official responsible for the government institution, perhaps focusing on the institution&rsquo;s annual performance report or expenditure plans;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Holding meetings with the senior responsible officer for any major government programmes led by the institution</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Seeking the advice of the Auditor General&rsquo;s Office on matters meriting the Committee&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Review of appointments&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="8">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees may also hold meetings to review proposed appointments by the President which are subject to their approval, or to give advice on proposed appointments on which the Government consults them.</span><span> The aim of these meetings is to gather information on the requirements of the office and whether the nominee has had adequate preparation for the role, and to ascertain whether they are competent.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>It is important that the committee demonstrates objectivity and impartiality in considering public appointments. The candidate should be given a fair hearing, and the questioning should focus on the required competences for the role. If Members are a relation, or close acquaintance, of the candidate, it is good practice not to take part.&nbsp; If the committee rejects the candidate, the reasons should be made clear and should relate to the required competences for the role.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
