                        <h3><span>Procedure in committee</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2">Wherever possible, committees should operate by consensus.&nbsp; A divided committee is likely to be less effective. Where there is a consensus, it is possible for committees to operate informally, without need for motions to be moved formally or for voting.&nbsp; This saves time and helps to maintain a sense of common purpose and team spirit. Even if there are differences of views on the committee, it may be possible to resolve these informally or for the majority view to be accepted without voting.</li>
<li aria-level="2">That said, it is good practice, and in the interests of transparency, for committees to decide certain matters formally and for these decisions to be recorded. These include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Agreement of reports</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Agreement of bills, and decisions on amendments to bills</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Decisions on proposed appointments</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Decisions which will lead to spending public money&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Usually these decisions are made without a vote. &nbsp; However, on occasions &ndash; either where the majority view is unclear or a member wishes to record their opposition to the majority view &ndash; the committee may need to vote.&nbsp; The chairperson does not take part in voting, but has a casting vote if the numbers are equal.</span><span>&nbsp; It is open to the chairperson to postpone a vote until more members are present.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>If voting is required, the usual practice is as follows [check]:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>A member proposes a question</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The chairperson puts the question and asks Members to raise their hands, firstly if they wish to vote for the question and secondly if they wish to vote against</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Members may abstain if they wish.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The clerk records the numbers voting each way</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The chairperson reads the result and declares that Ayes or Noes have won.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Record of Committee&rsquo;s decisions</span></h3>
<ol start="5">
<li aria-level="2"><span>An audio recording will be made of each committee meeting and a transcript will be provided and published.&nbsp; In addition the clerk will provide a summary of the proceedings, highlighting the decisions made</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Informal meetings</span></h3>
<ol start="6">
<li aria-level="2"><span>In addition to formal meetings of the committee, the chairperson can conduct informal/unofficial meetings, to prepare for committee meetings, to discuss a matter, or for committee training.</span><span> &nbsp; These informal meetings may take place both at the Majlis and elsewhere, as part of fact-finding field visits. &nbsp; Matters requiring a decision of the committee cannot be agreed at an informal meeting, and parliamentary privilege does not apply. There is no requirement for a quorum to be present for informal meetings, and they are not required to be open to the public or the media.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2">It is open to two or more committees to hold joint informal meetings. For example, committees met together&nbsp;to agree Code of Conduct / benchmarks.</li>
