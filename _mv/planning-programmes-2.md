<h3><span>Objective setting and measuring effectiveness</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>As well as agreeing a workplan, committees may also wish to agree objectives which they plan to achieve by the end of the Parliament (or a shorter timeframe, if preferred).&nbsp; These might include some intended outcomes, as well as committee outputs. It can be valuable to think about outcomes &ndash; the purpose of the committee&rsquo;s work &ndash; although they may not be within the power of the committee alone to deliver.&nbsp; It is not always easy for committee members, who may have conflicting political views and agendas, to agree common objectives, but an open discussion of differences and of potential common ground can be helpful in getting to know each other and in building team spirit.</span></li>
<br>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committees might also discuss whether there are measures, or key performance indicators, which would help to assess the committee&rsquo;s effectiveness. It is relatively simple to develop quantitative output measures (to assess whether the committee has delivered its workplan, for example) but more difficult to measure the quality of the committee&rsquo;s work, or whether it has delivered longer-term outcomes. Publishing performance measures signals that the committee is willing to practise what it preaches, and to be held to account, but it carries the risk of failure and future criticism, particularly if the objectives are ambitious and beyond the committee&rsquo;s own power to deliver. </span></li>
