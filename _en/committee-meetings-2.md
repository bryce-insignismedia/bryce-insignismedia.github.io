<h3><span>Setting the agenda</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The agenda for each meeting is determined by the chairperson.</span><span> [Other Members may raise issues if they wish.</span><span>]</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Public and private meetings&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="2">
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee meetings are normally in public, and open to the media, but committees may decide to meet behind closed doors.</span><span> However, it is open to committees to exclude the public and the press from all or any part of the proceedings if there is a compelling need to do so in the interests of public order or national security, or when material defamatory to individuals may be divulged.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Quorum</span></h3>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="2"><span>A committee cannot meet unless a quorum of the members are present.</span><span> Committees can decide what their quorum should be but it must be at least a third of the members.</span><span> It is open to committees to decide to have a different quorum for different purposes:&nbsp; for example, to require at least half of the committee to be present to agree a report.&nbsp; It is usual for committees to agree the quorum at their first meeting.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Attendance of other Members&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol start="4">
<li><span>Other Members of the Majlis may attend meetings of committees of which they are not a member, unless the meeting is declared as closed.</span><span>&nbsp; If the chairperson agrees, they may participate, but may not vote.</span></li>
