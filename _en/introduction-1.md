<li><span >This guidance is intended as a practical user-guide for Members of the Majlis who are appointed to committees.&nbsp; It is also intended to be useful for committee staff, and for others who are interested in how committees work.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span >Committee work is a vital part of a thriving parliamentary democracy.&nbsp; Committees allow the Majlis to carry out a range of work on behalf of the public.&nbsp; Some committees carry out oversight of Government; others have responsibility for parliamentary matters.</span></li>
<li><span>Committee work provides a great opportunity for Members of the Majlis to work together across party lines in the public interest, to acquire expertise, to gain public and media profile, and to have a positive impact on good government in Maldives.</span></li>
<li><span>This Committee guideline has been developed by the staff of the Majlis with the support from Westminster Foundation for Democracy.</span></li>
