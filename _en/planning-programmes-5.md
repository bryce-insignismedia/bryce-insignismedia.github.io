<h3><span>Visits / informal evidence gathering</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>While waiting for the written evidence to be submitted, and before embarking on formal evidence, the committee might carry out some informal information gathering.&nbsp; This could include:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Commissioning a review of the research already done in the inquiry area</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Informal briefings by the government institution or outside experts</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee visits to field sites around the country [or even overseas].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Individual visits by committee members to sites in their constituency or region</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Informal meetings or focus groups with service users or affected members of the public&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Online surveys or web forums &ndash; either on the Majlis website or hosted by a stakeholder body with an established contact network.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Witnesses and oral evidence sessions&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>While it is possible for committees to base their conclusions entirely on written evidence, it is usual to hold a number of formal oral hearings or evidence sessions with witnesses. How many sessions will be needed depends on the complexity of the inquiry and how much time is available.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>A longer inquiry might begin with evidence from the relevant Government Department or public body (to establish the factual base for the inquiry) and end with evidence from the relevant Minister (providing an opportunity for the committee to put the views of other witnesses and its emerging conclusions to the Minister).&nbsp; In between, there might be evidence from academic institutions, civil society organisations, individual experts and, sometimes, members of the public.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>When selecting witnesses to give oral evidence, committees should do their best to ensure a gender mix.&nbsp; In some cases, the committee may not have discretion over the choice of witness (for example, the relevant Minister may be a man), but it is open to committees to request that organisations giving evidence are represented by a gender-diverse panel. There is also value in hearing from more junior representatives of organisations, who have hands-on experience of an issue, rather than always from the chief executive. It will be more interesting for the committee and lead to better evidence, if it hears from a diverse range of witnesses.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Evidence sessions are normally held at the Majlis. It is possible to take formal evidence elsewhere, during field visits around the country, or even abroad, but it may be more practicable and appropriate to hold informal meetings when away from the Majlis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>At the start of an oral evidence session, the chairperson should explain briefly to all present the purpose and format of the meeting.&nbsp; Other Members should ask the leave of the chairperson before intervening, and the chairperson should aim to allow all members wishing to intervene to have an opportunity to do so.&nbsp; Committee members may communicate privately and unobtrusively with the chairperson during the session, perhaps by passing a note, to indicate when they wish to intervene or think that an issue needs to be pursued.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Effective evidence-taking requires committee members to ask questions, rather than expressing views, and to be concise in their questioning.&nbsp; Depending on the answers given, members may need to ask supplementary questions to clarify the issues or to press for further information. If witnesses do not have the information requested, they may be invited to provide it afterwards in writing. [Committee members may find it helpful to undertake training in questioning, either as a committee or individually.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Committee members should treat witnesses fairly and with respect, even if they have grounds to be critical of their conduct. It is important to the reputation of the committee that members should not appear to have prejudged an issue, and that witnesses have a fair opportunity to put their case. Attacking the witness is not likely to lead to useful evidence.<em>&nbsp;</em></span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>If taking evidence from members of the public, particularly from marginalised groups or young people, it may be appropriate to adapt the format of the meeting to make it less daunting.&nbsp; If you have young or vulnerable witnesses, the committee is responsible for their safeguarding. </span></li>
